# Contentful content duplicator

This script is used to duplicate content fron one env to antoher with one tag or another.
Please use this with great care. luckily the export script creates a __backup__ in the exports folder.

__Please only use this if you are a trained proffesional__

The file.json wil contain the modified data for logging purposes.

This wil only copy __content__ and __assets__  with *one tag* linked to it.

You can modify the source tag (`oldTag`) and the destination tag (`newTag`). and the env by updating the `sourceEnv`and the `destEnv`

use `npm start` to run the script.
